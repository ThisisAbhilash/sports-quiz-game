A sample sports trivia game, that fetches 10 questions from an API and let you pick your answer out of 4 options.
After having answered all, you submit your answers.
Then, it displays your score in bar-graph, and also reveals all the correct answers.

The app also differentiates between answered, un-answered and active questions, using different color for each.
